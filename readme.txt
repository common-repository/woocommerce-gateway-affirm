== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To
automatically install WooCommerce Gateway Affirm, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click **Add New**.

In the search field type "WooCommerce Gateway Affirm" and click **Search Plugins**. Once you've found our plugin you can install it by clicking **Install Now**, as well as view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Affirm is not showing. =
Confirm that:

- Your site’s currency is set to USD. Go to: WooCommerce > Settings > General > Currency.
- Customers have a U.S.-based billing address to use Affirm.
- SSL is enabled.
- Your site is in Live (not Test) mode.

= Nothing happens when customer attempts to pay with Affirm. =
This error may be caused by non-standard/poorly coded themes and JavaScript (JS) issues. Common issues include:

- JavaScript errors on checkout page – To view the error, open your browser error console (in Chrome: View > developer > JavaScript console) and look for red errors. This should indicate where the error is located and lead you to the problem, e.g., Loading jQuery incorrectly
- Failing to load scripts – Affirm loads JavaScript which it needs to function. If these are not loaded, you will see errors. Most common reasons are:
  - Theme is missing wp_head() or wp_footer() calls.
  - Old overridden template files from WooCommerce inside your theme.
  - Loading headers/footers in a non-standard way. WooCommerce uses get_header()’s get_header action to init the checkout and load scripts. If you are not using get_header() you either need to do so, or you need to trigger the get_header action manually using: do_action( ‘get_header ); in your custom header loader.

= Is it possible to override templates on the Affirm pages? =
No. These are fixed/static pages from Affirm.

= Why should the Enhanced Analytics box be unticked? =
At this time the feature is inactive on stores. The information can only be accessed by an Affirm representative.
